Towards the end of this project as I was fixing any memory leaks,
I noticed an error within pcap_compile() which was causing a memory leak.
This function is used to compile the filter expression with the session 
handle to filter for only ARP and ICMP packets. I could not find a 
workaround so I decided not use pcap's built in functionality to
pre-filter packets. The downside is that this will cause more overhead 
on the system.
